# Components

While designing the framework, the guiding philosophy was to break down the chart into parts and build each part individually. With decoupled components you have more flexibility to choose what to display and how to style it.

## Chart Components

Components add additional visual elements using nothing but CSS classes. You control what details to add in order to enhance your chart.

* [Wrapper](/components/wrapper/)
* [Heading](/components/heading/)
* [Data](/components/data/)
* [Datasets](/components/datasets/)
* [Orientation](/components/orientation/)
* [Labels](/components/labels/)
* [Axes](/components/axes/)
* [Spacing](/components/spacing/)
* [Reverse Order](/components/reverse-order/)
* [Colors](/components/colors/)
* [Stacked](/components/stacked/)

## External Components

With semantic markup in mind, some components can be displayed using separate HTML tags. You are not required to display those components with the chart, but if you do, you can choose where to display them.

* [Tooltips](/components/tooltips/)
* [Legend](/components/legend/)
