# Roadmap

This page shows the future development roadmap of the framework.

## Time Table

Planned development and the release of new chart types:

* ~~**October 2020** - Bar chart.~~

* ~~**October 2020** - Column chart.~~

* ~~**November 2020** - Area chart.~~

* ~~**November 2020** - Line chart.~~

* ~~**September 2023** - Pie chart.~~

* **2023/2024** - Radial chart.

* **TBD** - Polar Chart.

* **TBD** - Radar Chart.

## Long Term Roadmap

The framework will implement new features and components, not necessarily in that order. The long term goals are:

* **More Chart Types** - Add more chart types, start with the radial and pie charts.

* **Dual Axes Labels** - Support two independent secondary-labels, with one dataset on each side.

* **Build Tools** - Add more build tools.

* **Name Spacing** - Use namespaces for classes ~~& properties~~ to prevent conflicts with other CSS frameworks.

* **Component Prefixes** - Consider supporting component prefixes: `chart-axes:primary`, `chart-axes:*-secondary`, `chart-axes:data`, `chart-labels:show`, `chart-labels:align-end` etc.
