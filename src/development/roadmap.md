## Long Term Roadmap

The framework should implement new features and components. Not necessarily in that order, the long term goals are:

* **More Chart types** - Add more chart types, start with radial and pie charts.

* **Dual Axes Labels** - Support two independent secondary-labels, one dataset on each side.

* **Axis Titles** - Support axes titles. Primary axis title and secondary axis title.

* **Build Tools** - Add more build tools.

* **Responsive Control** - Support conditional display for different screen sizes. The code should look like this `sm:pie md:column xl:bar`.

* **Component Prefix** - Consider supporting component prefix: `axes:primary`, `axes:*-secondary`, `axes:data`, `labels:show`, `labels:align-end` etc.
